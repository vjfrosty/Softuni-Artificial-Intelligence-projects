## Introduction

This repository contains the final exam projects developed by student Yasen Ivanov as part of the Artificial Intelligence modul by Software University. The  projects will encompass various aspects of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, computer vision, and more. Each project is a testament to the hard work and creativity of the student.

## Project List

Below is a list of projects included in this showcase:

1. **Image segmentation with K-means clustering techniques** - **course: Math Concepts for Developers.**
   
   - **Description:** The project focuses on the application of KMeans clustering for image segmentation. Image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, involving the division of an image into meaningful parts for easier analysis and processing. The notebook outlines steps to perform image segmentation, primarily using the KMeans clustering algorithm, and showcases its applications in various fields such as object detection, image analysis, and data preprocessing.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, OpenCV.
   - **Link to Project:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vjfrosty/Softuni-Artificial-Intelligence-projects/blob/main/01_Math-Concepts-for-Developers/Exam_project_v1.ipynb)
